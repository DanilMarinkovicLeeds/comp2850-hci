Doesn't take into account your energy and how complex the tasks are.

Editing

### Q3: “Have you ever lost track of an important task? What happened?”
**Response**:
Yes, with a long task list, it was hard to track even with priority
### Q4: “Do you ever work without a mouse (trackpad broken, on train)? How does that change how you interact with apps?”
**Response**:
Not really, but sometimes I use arrows to navigate features and it doesn't impact it too much, just a bit more tedious
### Q5: "Have you used a task manager with your eyes closed or in bright sunlight? What was hard?”
**Response**:
Not with eyes closed, but bright sunlight makes it hard to see screen so avoid using it then.
### Q6: “If you could add one feature to make task management less stressful, what would it be?”
**Response**:
Feature that takes into account how complex tasks are, not just priority so you can complete simpler tasks when more tired.
